### Medium Description (150 words)

Experience Shanko, an engaging card game that brings family game night to your screen! Based on classic Rummy principles, Shanko challenges players through 7 rounds of increasing difficulty, where you'll form triplets (three matching cards) and sequences (four consecutive cards of the same suit).

What makes Shanko unique? The strategic "buying" mechanic lets you acquire discarded cards even when it's not your turn, adding depth and excitement to every play. Swap Jokers from melded sequences, extend combinations, and time your moves perfectly to achieve the lowest score.

Play solo against intelligent AI opponents or gather 2-8 players for multiplayer fun. With beautiful custom card artwork, smooth animations, and full accessibility support, Shanko delivers a premium card game experience on any device.

### Long Description (300+ words)

**Discover Shanko: The Ultimate Family Card Game Experience**

Shanko brings the beloved family card game tradition to the digital age with stunning visuals, strategic gameplay, and features that both newcomers and card game veterans will love.

**Progressive Challenge System**

Journey through 7 unique rounds, each with its own winning conditions:
- Round 1: Form 2 triplets (6 cards)
- Round 2: Form 1 triplet + 1 sequence (7 cards)
- Round 3: Form 2 sequences (8 cards)
- Round 4: Form 3 triplets (9 cards)
- Round 5: Form 2 triplets + 1 sequence (10 cards)
- Round 6: Form 2 sequences + 1 triplet (11 cards)
- Round 7: Form 3 sequences (12 cards)

Each round increases in complexity, testing your strategic thinking and card management skills.

**Unique Strategic Mechanics**

- **Buying System**: Don't wait for your turn! When another player discards a card you need, you can "buy" it by placing a card from the draw pile face-down. But choose wisely—you only get 3 buys per round!

- **Joker Management**: Jokers are wild cards worth 50 points. Use them strategically in your combinations, then swap them out later to reuse them and extend your sequences.

- **Meld Timing**: Decide when to reveal your combinations. Meld early to minimize risk, or wait for the perfect moment to surprise your opponents by going out in one turn!

**Features That Shine**

- **2-8 Players**: Play solo against AI or with friends and family
- **Smart AI Opponents**: Three difficulty levels provide appropriate challenges for all skill levels
- **Beautiful Custom Artwork**: Unique card designs that are clear, colorful, and easy to read
- **Smooth Animations**: Watch cards deal, draw, and discard with satisfying motion
- **Full Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and color-blind friendly modes
- **Responsive Design**: Play seamlessly on desktop, tablet, or mobile devices
- **Tutorial Mode**: Learn the rules with an interactive step-by-step guide
- **Score Tracking**: Cumulative scoring across all 7 rounds—lowest score wins!

**Perfect For**

- Family game nights
- Card game enthusiasts
- Strategy game lovers
- Casual gamers looking for depth
- Anyone who enjoys Rummy, Gin Rummy, or similar games

**Why Shanko?**

Unlike simple card games, Shanko rewards strategic thinking, risk assessment, and timing. The buying mechanic creates interactive gameplay where you're engaged even when it's not your turn. The progressive difficulty ensures that games stay fresh and challenging from start to finish.

Whether you're a seasoned card player or new to the genre, Shanko offers an accessible yet deep gaming experience that you'll want to play again and again.

**What is Shanko?**
It's a Rummy-style game with triplets and sequences, but with a twist: the "buying" mechanic lets you acquire discarded cards even when it's not your turn (with limits). This creates interactive gameplay where you're engaged throughout.

**Key Features:**

- Strategic depth beyond typical Rummy
