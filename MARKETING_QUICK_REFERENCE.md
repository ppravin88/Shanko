Title: [Digital] I made Shanko, a strategic Rummy variant with a unique buying mechanic

Hey r/boardgames! I've been working on a digital version of a family card game called Shanko, and I'd love to share it with you.

**What is Shanko?**
It's a Rummy-style game with triplets and sequences, but with a twist: the "buying" mechanic lets you acquire discarded cards even when it's not your turn (with limits). This creates interactive gameplay where you're engaged throughout.

**Key Features:**
- 7 rounds with progressive difficulty
- 2-8 players (AI or human)
- Strategic depth beyond typical Rummy
- Full accessibility support
- Free, no ads, no monetization

**Why I made it:**
This is a game my family has played for years, and I wanted to preserve it digitally and share it with others.

**Feedback Welcome:**
I'd love to hear your thoughts on gameplay, UI, balance, or anything else.

Thanks for checking it out!
