## Automation (Advanced)

For consistent screenshots, consider automation:

### Puppeteer Script Example

```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

async function captureScreenshots() {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  await page.setViewport({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });
  await page.goto('http://localhost:5173');
  
  // Capture setup screen
  await page.screenshot({ 
    path: 'screenshot-01-setup.png',
    fullPage: false 
  });
  
  // Start game and capture gameplay
  await page.click('#start-game-button');
  await page.waitForTimeout(2000);
  await page.screenshot({ 
    path: 'screenshot-02-gameplay.png' 
  });
  
  await browser.close();
}

captureScreenshots();
```

## Final Notes

- **Consistency is key:** Use same browser, zoom level, and settings
- **Show real gameplay:** Avoid staged or fake scenarios
- **Highlight features:** Each screenshot should showcase something specific
- **Keep updated:** Retake screenshots when UI changes
