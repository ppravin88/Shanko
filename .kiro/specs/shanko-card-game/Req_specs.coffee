I have an idea for a family card game that I want to commercialize for the masses. 
It's an original idea for the card game that's been played for ages among my family members using one or more traditional pack of playing cards. 
However, I want to make it much more enticing so as to commercialize it with a custom deck. 
The game's name is called Shanko! It has got 7 rounds of play with increasing difficulty. 
In each round, 11 cards are dealt to all the players. 
It's a complete family game built on the core elements of Rummy: triplets and sequences. 
A triplet indicates a set of 3 card item where the same card number should be represented. 
The cards can belong to different suits too here but not necessarily. 
A sequence indicates a set of 4 card item where the card numbers have to be in a sequence but should belong to the same card suit.


Rounds:

Round 1: 2 triplets
Round 2: 1 triplet + 1 sequence
Round 3: 2 sequences
Round 4: 3 triplets
Round 5: 2 triplets + 1 sequence
Round 6: 2 sequences + 1 triplet
Round 7: 3 sequences


Points are calculated for the remaining cards in hand.
Number cards are calculated at face value.
J, Q, K at 10 points each.
Ace (A) at 15 points.
Joker (wild card) at 50 points.
Lowest points at the end of 7 rounds wins.

The custom deck will also have the 52 cards as in the standard deck + 2 jokers (wild cards)

The Wild cards can be used in any triplet or sequence; any number of wild cards can be used in any triplet/sequence but there should be at least one standard number card or J,Q,K,A in that triplet/sequence.

Game play:

The youngest player starts first in Round 1; from Round 2 onwards the player sitting to the left (in a round-robin form) of the player who started first in R1 will start
A player starts their turn by drawing a card either from the draw pile or the discard pile in the center and ends their turn play discarding a card to the discard pile

The concept of 'Buying' cards:
The game has a special concept called Buying. 
When a player wants a card that is discarded by any player other than preceeding player then they can 'Buy' the card from the discard pile.
Buying happens by taking the top card from the draw pile and placing it face-down on the top card on the discard pile that the player intends to buy.
A card can be bought only if it has been just discarded and is at the top of the discard pile.
A player can only buy thrice in a round.
The buys gets replenished for each new round.
Unused buys in a round cannot be carry-forwarded to the next rounds.
When 2 or more players want to buy the same card, then the first preference is given to the player whose turn of play is the  most immediate (in the clock-wise direction of gameplay)

Melding the cards:
A player can meld their cards down when they have met the objective of that particular round (i.e., 2 triplets in R1, 2 sequences in R3 and so on)
The player can decide when to meld their cards. They can meld only during their turn of gameplay.
In order to meld they should start their turn as usual by drawing a card and after melding their should finish by discarding a card.
If the player has only one card to discard after melding then they are 'going-out' i.e., the round has ended and no more further plays are allowed; all the players will then count their hand.
When a player is going-out then they put their last card face-down on the discard pile.

Once a player has melded their cards they then forfeit their unsued buys (if any) for that particular round.
A player can only meld once per round.
A player who has melded will not be considered for preference in the act of buying cards.

A player who has melded can swap wild cards in any of theirs or other player's melded sets (in the same or subsequent turns of their gameplay) and can reuse the wild card in any of the melded sets (either theirs or others) to extend sequences thereby discarding additional cards from their hands before finishing their turn.

The ideal playing size would be 3 to 8 players. However, 2 players can also play the game, the concept of buying would be irrelevant here.
You'd need 2 standard decks for a size of 3 to 4. An additional deck for 5 to 6 and 2 additional decks for 7 to 8.

Instead of 2 wild cards per deck make it 4 wild cards per deck

If real human players are not available include AI bots to play that are aware of all the rules of the game

Expert Tips:
In R7, it is mandatory to 'buy' at least one card so as to 'go-out' as the players are dealt only 11 cards in each round.
A player can meld their hand in such a way that they can 'go-out' all at once thereby pulling a surprise strike against other players even if they had met that particular round's objective in quite earlier turns

Invalid declaration penalty: No penalty here; melding isn't allowed if that particular round's objective isn't met.

Sequence wrapping: One can end a sequence with A such as J,Q,K,A or begin a sequence with A such as A,2,3,4 but wrapping is not allowed.

Multiple buys timing: The player buying will ask the other players prior to him in the gameplay whether they need the card before executing his buy privilege; they don't have to be concerned about the players after them in the gameplay as they will be at a lower preference than them anyways.

Joker swap validation: When swapping a Joker from someone else's melded set, you can only swap it with the specific valid card the Joker was representing; swapping is allowed only for sequences; triplets having any wild cards can never ever be swapped.

Extending sequences: When you extend a melded sequence (like adding to a 4-card sequence to make it 5 or 6 cards), you can extend in either direction (beginning or end)

Game start: Who shuffles and deals? Is there a dealer role that rotates? - No explicit dealer roles; anyone can do it.
