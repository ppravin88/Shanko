### Script

**[0:00-0:15] Introduction**

*Voiceover:*
"Welcome to Shanko, a strategic card game that combines classic Rummy with unique mechanics. In this tutorial, you'll learn everything you need to start playing. Let's dive in!"

*Visual:*
- Game logo
- Transition to game setup screen

**[0:15-0:45] Game Setup**

*Voiceover:*
"First, choose your player count. Shanko supports 2 to 8 players. You can play with friends or against AI opponents. For this tutorial, we'll set up a 4-player game with 2 humans and 2 AI players."

*Visual:*
- Show player count selector
- Configure players
- Show deck count indicator
- Click "Start Game"

**[0:45-1:30] Basic Rules**

*Voiceover:*
"The goal is simple: form the required combinations for each round and achieve the lowest score across 7 rounds. There are two types of combinations:

Triplets: Three cards of the same rank, like three 7s.
Sequences: Four consecutive cards of the same suit, like 5, 6, 7, 8 of hearts.

Each round has different requirements. Round 1 requires 2 triplets. Round 2 requires 1 triplet and 1 sequence. And so on, getting progressively harder."

*Visual:*
- Show examples of valid triplets
- Show examples of valid sequences
- Display round objectives for all 7 rounds
- Highlight current round objective

**[1:30-2:15] Turn Structure**

*Voiceover:*
"On your turn, you'll do three things:

First, draw a card from either the draw pile or the discard pile.
Second, if you have the required combinations, you can meld them by clicking the Meld button.
Third, discard one card to end your turn.

Let's see this in action."

*Visual:*
- Show drawing from draw pile
- Show drawing from discard pile
- Show hand after drawing
- Show meld button
- Show discarding a card

**[2:15-3:00] The Buying Mechanic**

*Voiceover:*
"Here's where Shanko gets interesting. When another player discards a card you need, you can 'buy' it even when it's not your turn!

To buy, click the Buy button. You'll receive the discarded card plus one card from the draw pile. But be strategic—you only get 3 buys per round!

Note: Buying is disabled in 2-player games, and once you meld, you can't buy anymore."

*Visual:*
- Show another player discarding
- Show Buy button appearing
- Show buy dialog
- Show receiving both cards
- Show buys remaining counter

**[3:00-3:30] Jokers**

*Voiceover:*
"Jokers are wild cards that can substitute for any card in your combinations. They're powerful but risky—if you're caught with one in your hand, it's worth 50 points!

After melding, you can swap Jokers from sequences by replacing them with the actual card. This lets you reuse the Joker to extend other sequences."

*Visual:*
- Show Joker in a combination
- Show Joker swap dialog
- Show swapping process
- Show extending a sequence with the swapped Joker

**[3:30-4:00] Going Out and Scoring**

*Voiceover:*
"When you have all required combinations, you can 'go out' by melding and discarding your final card face-down. This ends the round, and you score zero points!

Other players score points based on cards left in their hand:
- Number cards: face value
- Face cards: 10 points
- Aces: 15 points
- Jokers: 50 points

After 7 rounds, the player with the lowest total score wins!"

*Visual:*
- Show going out process
- Show round end screen
- Show score calculation
- Show cumulative scores

**[4:00-4:30] Strategy Tips**

*Voiceover:*
"Here are some quick tips:

Save your buys for cards that complete combinations.
Use Jokers in sequences rather than triplets so you can swap them later.
Decide whether to meld early for safety or wait to surprise opponents.
Pay attention to what others are discarding to avoid helping them.

Now you're ready to play! Good luck!"
