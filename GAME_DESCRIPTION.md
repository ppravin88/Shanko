## Tagline
Strategic card gameplay that keeps everyone engaged, even when it's not your turn.

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
Shanko is a strategic family card game that combines classic Rummy mechanics with innovative buying and Joker-swapping features. Play through 7 progressively challenging rounds, form triplets and sequences, and compete against friends or AI opponents. Perfect for families and card game enthusiasts who love strategic depth!

## Short Description (100 words)
Experience Shanko, an engaging card game that brings family game night to your screen! Based on classic Rummy principles, Shanko challenges players through 7 rounds of increasing difficulty, where you'll form triplets (three matching cards) and sequences (four consecutive cards of the same suit).

What makes Shanko unique? The strategic "buying" mechanic lets you acquire discarded cards even when it's not your turn, adding depth and excitement to every play. Swap Jokers from melded sequences, extend combinations, and time your moves perfectly to achieve the lowest score across all rounds.

## Full Description (500+ words)

### Overview
Shanko brings the beloved family card game tradition to the digital age with stunning visuals, strategic gameplay, and features that both newcomers and card game veterans will love. This isn't just another Rummy clone—it's a carefully crafted experience that rewards strategic thinking, timing, and risk assessment.

### How to Play

**The Basics**
- 2-8 players compete across 7 unique rounds
- Each player receives 11 cards at the start of each round
- Form triplets (3 matching cards) and sequences (4 consecutive cards of same suit)
- Draw a card, optionally meld your combinations, then discard
- First player to "go out" ends the round with zero points
- Lowest cumulative score after 7 rounds wins!

**Progressive Challenge System**
Each round has unique winning conditions that increase in complexity:

- **Round 1**: Form 2 triplets (6 cards)
- **Round 2**: Form 1 triplet + 1 sequence (7 cards)
- **Round 3**: Form 2 sequences (8 cards)
- **Round 4**: Form 3 triplets (9 cards)
- **Round 5**: Form 2 triplets + 1 sequence (10 cards)
- **Round 6**: Form 2 sequences + 1 triplet (11 cards)
- **Round 7**: Form 3 sequences (12 cards)

This progression ensures that games stay fresh and challenging from start to finish.

### Unique Strategic Mechanics

**The Buying System**
Don't wait for your turn! When another player discards a card you need, you can "buy" it by placing a card from the draw pile face-down on top of it. This adds both the discarded card and the face-down card to your hand.

Strategic considerations:
- You only get 3 buys per round—use them wisely!
- Buying is disabled in 2-player games
- Once you meld, you forfeit remaining buys
- Buy priority goes to players closest to their turn

**Joker Management**
Jokers are powerful wild cards worth 50 points if left in your hand. Use them strategically:
- Substitute for any card in triplets or sequences
- Swap them out later when you get the actual card
- Reuse swapped Jokers to extend sequences
- Note: Jokers can only be swapped from sequences, not triplets!

**Meld Timing**
Deciding when to reveal your combinations is crucial:
- Meld early to minimize risk if someone else goes out
- Wait to surprise opponents by melding and going out in one turn
- Consider opponent progress before committing
- Remember: once you meld, you can't buy anymore!

### Scoring System
Points are calculated based on cards remaining in your hand when someone goes out:
- Number cards (2-10): Face value
- Face cards (J, Q, K): 10 points each
- Aces: 15 points
- Jokers: 50 points

The player who goes out scores zero for that round. After 7 rounds, the player with the lowest cumulative score wins!

### Why Shanko Stands Out

**Strategic Depth**: The buying mechanic creates interactive gameplay where you're engaged throughout the game, not just on your turn. Every discard matters because any player might buy it.

**Progressive Difficulty**: Seven unique rounds ensure variety and prevent repetition. Early rounds are accessible for newcomers, while later rounds challenge even experienced players.

**Balanced Mechanics**: Jokers are powerful but risky (50 points if caught). Buying gives you more cards but costs a limited resource. Melding early is safe but prevents future buying. Every decision has trade-offs.

**Polished Experience**: Smooth animations, clear visual feedback, and intuitive controls make the game feel premium. Accessibility features ensure everyone can play comfortably.

**No Monetization**: Completely free to play with no ads, no in-app purchases, and no registration required. Just pure card game fun.

### Technical Excellence

- **Fast Loading**: Optimized assets and code splitting
- **Offline Play**: Works without internet after initial load (PWA)
- **Cross-Browser**: Compatible with all modern browsers
- **Performance**: Smooth 60fps animations
- **Responsive**: Adapts to any screen size
- **Accessible**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

### Game Statistics

- **Players**: 2-8 (human or AI)
- **Rounds**: 7 unique objectives
- **Cards**: 2-4 decks (112-224 cards) based on player count
- **Average Game Time**: 20-40 minutes
- **Skill Ceiling**: High—mastery takes practice
- **Replayability**: Infinite—every game is different
