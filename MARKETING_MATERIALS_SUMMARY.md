## Tips for Success

### 1. Start Small
Don't try to do everything at once. Start with:
- 6 core screenshots
- 1 promo video
- Basic website
- Social media announcement

Then expand from there.

### 2. Quality Over Quantity
Better to have 3 amazing screenshots than 14 mediocre ones. Take your time, follow the guides, and create professional assets.

### 3. Test Everything
Before launching:
- View screenshots on different devices
- Watch videos on different platforms
- Test website on mobile and desktop
- Get feedback from friends/family

### 4. Iterate Based on Feedback
Marketing is not "set it and forget it." Monitor what works:
- Which screenshots get the most engagement?
- Which video performs best?
- What messaging resonates?
- Where is traffic coming from?

Then adjust your strategy accordingly.

### 5. Leverage Your Strengths
If you're great at writing, focus on blog posts and descriptions.
If you're good at video, create more video content.
If you're a designer, make beautiful graphics.

Play to your strengths and outsource or simplify the rest.
